# NOvid-20 - An effort to control the spread of COVID-19
NO COVID-19 in 2020. 
A website I made with help from my teammates,
deploys an ML model to predict the chances of a person to have contracted the coronavirus based on their symptoms, 
has a chatbot that answers your queries related to the virus , 
stores user data in a Firebase database, 
helps users get answers to several questions without leaving the comfort of their homes, and 
helps control unneccesary crowding at hospitals/clinics.
